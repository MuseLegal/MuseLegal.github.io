<h2>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING OR ACCESSING THE JUDICATA SERVICE.</h2>

<p>By executing or accepting any Subscription with Judicata, clicking the “I accept” button in connection with Judicata’s online registration process, and/or using the Judicata Service, you agree to these T&amp;C either for yourself or on behalf of your employer or another entity if so specified. If you are accepting and/or executing on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent and warrant that you have read and understand, have the full legal authority to, and hereby bind your employer or such entity to these T&amp;C. If you do not have such legal authority, or you do not agree with the T&amp;C, you must not accept these T&amp;C and you may not use the Judicata Service.</p>

<p>The content available through the Judicata Service and on the Judicata Website does not constitute legal advice and no attorney-client relationship is formed. The accuracy, completeness, adequacy or currency of the Content in the Judicata Service is not warranted or guaranteed. Your use of the Judicata Service or materials linked from the Judicata Service is at your own risk.</p>

<h2>1. REGISTRATION.</h2>
<p>To access and use the Judicata Service you will be required to register with Judicata by completing a registration form and designating a user ID and password. When registering with Judicata you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Judicata Service’s registration form (such information being the “<strong>Registration Data</strong>”) and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or we have grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Judicata Service (or any portion thereof).</p>

<p>You may not authorize any third party to access or use the Judicata Service on your behalf.

<h2>2. FEES AND PAYMENT.</h2>
<p>In the event you choose to subscribe to the Judicata Service, you agree to the pricing, payment and billing policies as set forth (a) herein, (b) online and/or (c) in a separately executed or accepted Subscription. All fees are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these T&amp;C. Subscription fees shall be payable in advance for each month and any special service charges shall be payable within thirty (30) days of Judicata’s invoice. All fees and applicable taxes, if any, are payable in United States dollars. You are solely responsible for the payment of, and shall pay when due, all applicable sales and use taxes and similar fees now in force, enacted or imposed in the future on the delivery of Judicata Service and/or any related transactions (except for taxes assessed on Judicata’s net income or personal property).</p>

<p>Your Judicata Service subscription starts on the date that you sign up for a Judicata Service plan and submit payment via a current, valid and accepted payment method as specified by Judicata on the payment page (the “<strong>Payment Method</strong>”). Unless we otherwise communicate a different time period to you at the time of sign up, each Judicata Service offering is one month in length (a “<strong>Membership Cycle</strong>”), and will automatically renew each month until your membership is cancelled or terminated. For example, if you purchase your Judicata Service on April 5, your membership will automatically renew and you will be billed on May 5. We will automatically bill the monthly subscription fee to your Payment Method each month until your subscription is cancelled or terminated.</p>

<p>We may offer a number of Judicata Service plans, including special promotional plans, with differing conditions and limitations. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered Judicata Service plans. See here for the Judicata Service plans we currently offer: <a href="login_next=_docs_subscriptions.html">https://www.judicata.com/docs/subscriptions</a></p>

<p>Your subscription to the Judicata Service will automatically renew, unless we terminate it, or you notify us via the Judicata Service or by email to <a href="mailto:cancel@judicata.com">cancel@judicata.com</a> of your decision to terminate your current subscription. You must cancel any such subscription within five (5) days before it renews: if you do not cancel within that time period, you shall be liable for any subscription fees we charge you for the next renewal term.</p>

<h2>12. ARBITRATION.</h2>
<p>INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS. To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement (“<strong>Dispute</strong>”), you and Judicata agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to Judicata. Judicata’s address for such notices is Judicata, Inc., 450 Townsend St, Suite 100, San Francisco, CA 94107; Attention: Legal.</p>

<p>BINDING ARBITRATION. If you and Judicata are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Judicata Service (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) of the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“<strong>AAA Consumer Rules</strong>”), both of which are available at the <a href="https://www.adr.org">AAA website</a>. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Judicata may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>

<p>EXCEPTIONS TO ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court in San Francisco County, California with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights.</p>

<p>WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. You and Judicata agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Judicata and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND JUDICATA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Judicata otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” Section will be deemed null and void.</p>

<p>LOCATION OF ARBITRATION. Arbitration will take place in San Francisco County, California. You and Judicata agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the California state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction and you and Judicata agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>

<h2>13.  INDEMNIFICATION.</h2>
<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Judicata and its subsidiaries, agents, licensors, managers, and other affiliated companies, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the Judicata Service, including any data or content transmitted or received by you; (ii) your violation of any term of this Agreement, including without limitation your breach of any of the representations and warranties above; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy, publicity rights or Proprietary Information; (iv) your violation of any law, rule or regulation of the United States or any other country; or (v) any other party’s access and use of the Judicata Service with your unique username, password or other appropriate security code.</p>

<h2>14.  ASSIGNMENT OF TERMS.</h2>
<p>Neither party may assign or transfer this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer this Agreement, without such consent, will be null and of no effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate or to an entity acquiring all or substantially all of the assets or business of such party, upon notice to the other party.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. The term “<strong>Affiliate</strong>” shall mean, as to a party hereto, any person or entity who directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such party.</p>

<h2>15. GENERAL TERMS.</h2>
<p>Judicata reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these T&amp;C at any time, for any reason or for no reason. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the amended T&amp;C on the Judicata Website at <a href="terms.html">https://www.judicata.com/terms</a>.

<p>If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.</p>

<p>If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>

<p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</p>

<p>This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions of California which would require or permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.</p>
