    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <hr class="gradient-separator">
    <p><i>Effective Date: June 1, 2014</i>
<br><br></p>

<p>Judicata is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of information about our users and their organizations. This Judicata Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal and company information when you visit the Website or use the Judicata Service.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and considered a part of, the Judicata Terms and Conditions, currently located at <a href="terms.html">http://www.judicata.com/terms</a>. Any capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms and Conditions.</p>

<p><strong>1. CLIENT CONSENT.</strong><br>
By submitting or making available Derived Data or Personal Data (as defined below) through our Website or the Judicata Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Derived Data and Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>

<p><strong>2. TYPES OF PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT.</strong><br>
<i>User-Supplied Information</i><br/>
When you register for the Judicata Service, sign up for newsletters, complete forms for optional programs, surveys, contests and other entries, or at other points in our Website that state that Personal Data is being collected, we may ask you to, or you may voluntarily provide personal information, for example, your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, professional title, company name, area of law practice, and/or certain additional categories of information resulting from use of the Judicata Website and the Judicata Service (collectively, “<strong>Personal Data</strong>”). In addition, we (or our third-party credit card or payment processor on our behalf) will collect Personal Data including your credit card number or account information when you subscribe to the Judicata Service. We keep Personal Data related to your Subscription in a contact database for future reference, as needed.</p>

<p>If you contact us for Client support, we may ask you to provide information about your computer or about the issues you are trying to resolve. This information is necessary to help us answer your questions. We may record your requests and our responses for quality control purposes.</p>

<p><i>Web Server Logs</i><br/>
When you visit the Website, we may track information about your visit and store that information in web server logs, which are records of the activities on our Website. Our servers automatically capture and save the information electronically. Examples of the information we may collect include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your unique Internet protocol address<br/></p></li>
<li><p>The name of your unique Internet service provider<br/></p></li>
<li><p>The city, state, and country from which you access our Website<br/></p></li>
<li><p>The kind of browser or computer you use<br/></p></li>
<li><p>The number of links you click within the Website<br/></p></li>
<li><p>The date and time of your visit<br/></p></li>
<li><p>The web page from which you arrived to our Website<br/></p></li>
<li><p>The pages you viewed on the Website<br/></p></li>
<li><p>Certain searches/queries that you conducted via our Website</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The information we collect in web server logs helps us administer the Judicata Website, analyze its usage, protect the website and its content from inappropriate use, and improve the user&#8217;s experience.</p>

<p><i>Cookies</i><br/>
In order to offer and provide a customized and personal service, we may use cookies to store and help track information about you. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience while using the Judicata Service.</p>

<p>The use of cookies is relatively standard. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, if you prefer, Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our Website and/or the Judicata Service may not function correctly.</p>

<p><i>Third Party Services</i><br/>
We may use services hosted by third parties, such as Google Analytics, to assist in providing our services and to help us understand our Clients&#8217; use of our products. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including your IP address or cookies (“Derived Data”). If these third party services collect information, they do so anonymously and in the aggregate to provide information helpful to us such as website trends, without identifying individual visitors. Derived Data may be stored indefinitely. Please see &#8220;Cookies&#8221; in the section above for information on how you can control the use of cookies on your computer.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the use and disclosure of Personal Data and Derived Data that we collect while you use the Judicata Service. Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. When you click on such a link, you will leave our Website and go to another website. During this process, a third party may collect Personal Data or Derived Data from you.</p>

<p>We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on a link to a third party.</p>
